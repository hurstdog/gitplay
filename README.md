==================

This is a repository that I'm using to learn git. Nothing fancy, just a bunch
of random check-ins and notes. I don't expect anyone to use it but me.

The directions I'm following to learn git are here: http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Getting-a-Git-Repository

NOTES.md has all the real details.
